RASA Plugin and Text-to-Speech Process

• Python developments are consistent in the "python REST API" folder under "adams" main project structure.

Main Objective: - Implement the connection between Flutter mobile application and RASA framework. 

Sub Objectives: -	• Implementation of Webhook API
		• Python REST API development

Prerequisites: -	• PyCharm 2020.1.2
		• Python 3.7 
		• Flask plugin

Process: -

• Values of the user validation status, user email, logging count, session id, and translated important facts of the medical answer fields should be sent into the RASA process from Flutter mobile application.

• By creating a Python GET API in  PyCharm IDEA, these parameters have been sent into the RASA process. The Python REST API is developed with the support of the Flask framework. Flask plugin is imported in the PyCharm IDEA.

• Up and running Python GET API URL is called in Flutter application and necessary parameters are parsed into this REST API.

• Simultaneously, the user's medical question is sent into the RASA NLU with the aid of the Python Webhook API. Also, this Webhook API is sent as a POST request method. 

• At the end of the Dialogue Management Process, the medical answer will be received through the Webhook API along with the previous POST request.
